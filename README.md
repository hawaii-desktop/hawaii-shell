This is the Hawaii desktop environment shell and workspace.

It contains a Qt platform theme plugin, session manager, QML plugins
and a convergent shell for multiple form factors such as desktops,
netbooks, phones and tablets.

Only the desktop shell is implemented and actively pursuit at the
moment, more will come after version 1.0.
